        <description>Standardization alone will not solve everything - further progress will require a revolution of efficiency and precision. New standards for optimization, accuracy, and capability will need to be developed. Once achieved, humanity's more wild ideas fall within reach.</description>

        <description>With the acquisition of proper fabrication capabilities and a strong standardization scheme, advancements in the quality of mechanical parts is now within reach. There is spare space in all synstruct cores for protective padding purposes - advanced specialized chips could occupy some of that space instead.</description>
